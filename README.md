# Blubber

## What is it?
Blubber is intended to be a clone of Twitter (with a limited subset of features). I took up this personal project to try to apply my knowledge of backend and frontend
technologies together to build a full stack web application, and to also explore how state management in frontend (React Redux in this case) worked.

This repo is the frontend of the app. I have built it mostly using React, Redux and Material-UI.
The backend repo of the app can be found at: https://github.com/RaymondCJA/blubber

## Installation

Fork/clone to your project directory:

```sh
git clone `forkedRepoName`
```


## Usage

Run the app after installing and setting it up with:

```
npm install
npm start
```

### Note as of August 2022: 
- Newer versions of React-router-dom will break the API - you will need to downgrade to version 5
- Material UI has went through several major changes since the project has been written. While
the current code will continue to work, existing documentation will look different to what has been written.

## Planned features (in the future)
- User image uploads
- Signup state for react
- Implementing frontend for like/unlike/comment/notifications
- Deployment to firebase
- Display comments
- User profile page


## Licensing/Can I use this project?
Please go ahead, the code is entirely open source.
